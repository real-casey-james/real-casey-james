### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a full stack web developer with a background in youth work, accounting, technology management and hospitality. This has given me excellent interpersonal and communication skills. I build strong relationships with others quickly, and help create effective teams that produce awesome work. I love problem solving, especially with others.

Iâ€™m excited about coding. It doesnâ€™t feel like work to me, and I love learning new pieces. I dream in code and often unintentionally solve problems while exercising or in the shower!

I am looking to join an organisation that will support my growth, help develop my career, and teach me cool things. In return I will work hard, learn quickly, and positively contribute to your teams.
